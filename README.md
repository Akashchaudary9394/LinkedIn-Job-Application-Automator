python
# Skills extraction output
{
    "tech_stack": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
    "technical_skills": ["System Design", "Microservices"],
    "required_skills": ["5+ years experience", "Team Leadership"],
    "nice_to_have": ["Kubernetes", "Docker"]
}
Multi-Model Flexibility
Switch between AI providers based on your needs:

python
# Support for multiple AI providers
